## RequestValidator
The provided TypeScript module declaration extends the `@ioc:Adonis/Addons/NatsRequest` module to include an additional method for request validation. Here's a summary of the extension:

1. **`NatsRequestContract`**: This interface extends the existing `NatsRequestContract` and introduces a new method:

   - `validate<T>`: This method is used for validating the current NATS request. It takes a generic type parameter `T` that represents a schema definition for the expected request data. The `T` type should be a schema that extends `ParsedTypedSchema<TypedSchema>`. The method accepts either a `Function` or an `Object` (validator) as its argument, which defines the validation rules.

The purpose of this extension is to provide a convenient method for validating NATS requests based on a defined schema. Developers can use this method to ensure that the received data adheres to the expected structure and validation rules, making it easier to handle and process requests within the AdonisJS application.
