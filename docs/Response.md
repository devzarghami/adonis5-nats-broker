## Response
The provided TypeScript class seems to be an implementation of a custom response object for handling NATS responses in an AdonisJS application. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **Constructor**: The class constructor initializes various properties, including the status code, response headers, and response body. It accepts a callback function that is used to send the response.

2. **Header Methods**:
  - `getHeader(key)`: Retrieves the existing value for a given NATS response header.
  - `getHeaders()`: Returns all response headers.

3. **`header(key, value)` Method**: Sets a response header. It allows appending values to existing headers.

4. **`getStatus()` Method**: Retrieves the status code for the response.

5. **`status(code)` Method**: Sets the NATS status code for the response.

6. **`send(body)` Method**: Sends the response body and headers. It can also generate an ETag if configured. The response body is encoded as JSON and sent to the callback function.

7. **HTTP Status Methods**: The class provides methods for setting specific HTTP status codes and sending a response body associated with each status code. These methods include `continue()`, `switchingProtocols()`, `ok()`, `created()`, `accepted()`, and many more.

8. **HTTP Status Methods (Continued)**: The class includes methods for various HTTP status codes, such as `nonAuthoritativeInformation()`, `noContent()`, `resetContent()`, `partialContent()`, and others. Each method sets the corresponding status code and can send a response body if provided.

The custom response class enables handling NATS responses with the ability to set status codes, headers, and send response bodies. It closely resembles the functionality of a typical HTTP response object in a web application framework but adapted for use with NATS messaging.
